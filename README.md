# Social-Network-Analysis-Project

**Abstract:** Every content-maker wants to make it to the top and become popular. But would it be easier to achieve this goal on your own, counting solely on your skills, or is it better to use the help (and popularity) of other bloggers to become popular yourself? The aim of this paper is to analyse if popularity is linked in any way to the number of videos a blogger makes by using of networks.

The analysis was conducted on a network of over 10K videos, whose semantics is given by the popularity index. The data has been collected through YouTube Data API v3 and analyzed using Python Library "NetworkX".

The popularity of a blogger is influenced by the number of videos in most cases, although there exist some YouTubers who are extremely popular on their own, without having too many connections, or, on the contrary, they have many connections, but their popularity index has a lower value .
